# This file lists blob containers that will be mounted to the Cromwell host, so they are available for WDL commands that access the files from the Cromwell host.

# Accepted formats are:
# 1. Blob container URL with SAS, for cases where CoA VM does not have access to the storage account (containers from other Azure tenants).
#    https://<storage account name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>?<SAS token>
# 2. /<storage account name>/<container name>, where the identity '{ManagedIdentityName}' has 'Contributor' role on the storage account.

# In both cases, the containers are mounted as /<storage account name>/<container name> on the Cromwell host.
# Similarly, when specifying file paths in inputs.json files, use the same approach to refer to Azure blobs: /<storage account name>/<container name>/<blob name>
# You may also use http URIs for input files, but WDL commands that access the files from the Cromwell host will not be able to access them.

# Wildcards are supported. For example:
# - to include all containers in an account, enter /mystorageaccount/*
# - to include all containers in all accounts, enter *
# Only those accounts that the identity '{ManagedIdentityName}' has 'Contributor' role on will actually be considered.

# Exclusions are supported and processed after inclusions:
# - to exclude specific account or container, prefix the line with "-", for example -/mystorageaccount/private

# Comments are allowed only at the beginning of the line.
# Changes in this file take effect after VM restart.

# Required containers, don't delete these lines:

/{DefaultStorageAccountName}/configuration
/{DefaultStorageAccountName}/cromwell-executions
/{DefaultStorageAccountName}/cromwell-workflow-logs

# Optional containers, should list all containers where your input files are located:

/{DefaultStorageAccountName}/inputs
