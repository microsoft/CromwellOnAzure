    /// Task states.   - UNKNOWN: The state of the task is unknown.  This provides a safe default for messages where this field is missing, for example, so that a missing field does not accidentally imply that the state is QUEUED.  - QUEUED: The task is queued.  - INITIALIZING: The task has been assigned to a worker and is currently preparing to run. For example, the worker may be turning on, downloading input files, etc.  - RUNNING: The task is running. Input files are downloaded and the first Executor has been started.  - PAUSED: The task is paused.  An implementation may have the ability to pause a task, but this is not required.  - COMPLETE: The task has completed running. Executors have exited without error and output files have been successfully uploaded.  - EXECUTOR_ERROR: The task encountered an error in one of the Executor processes. Generally, this means that an Executor exited with a non-zero exit code.  - SYSTEM_ERROR: The task was stopped due to a system error, but not from an Executor, for example an upload failed due to network issues, the worker's ran out of disk space, etc.  - CANCELED: The task was canceled by the user.
