## Update instructions

You can update any previous CoA deployment to 3.1.0:
1. Follow instructions to [run the deployment executable](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure#run-the-deployment-executable), and for arguments, specify `--Update true --SubscriptionId abc123 --ResourceGroupName mycoa --VmPassword password` with the correct values for your existing CoA deployment. If you don't remember the password for the `vmadmin` user, you can reset it via the Azure Portal or Azure CLI.  Example:<br/>
 
`.\deploy-cromwell-on-azure.exe --Update true --SubscriptionId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --ResourceGroupName mycoa --VmPassword password`
