# Release Notes - 3.0.0
## Features

1.	Preliminary support for [GA4GH TES 1.1](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas/tree/develop-1.1).  This adds the ability for workflow authors to select a specific Azure VM size to be used for a workflow task, enabling the use of any VM size in Azure.  This can be done by setting a key/value for "vm_size" with the Azure VM SKU name in the WDL runtime section.  This preliminary support was included in Cromwell 73.  


## Bug fixes and enhancements

1. Fixes an issue where Azure Storage account containers are not properly mounted in Cromwell, resulting in workflow failures.  This was fixed by disabling the auto-start of the Docker service on the host VM, and relying on "startup.sh" to start the Docker service at startup.
2. Fixes an issue where the deployer fails when the user does not have the ability to list Azure Storage accounts in one of their subscriptions
3. The classic version of App Insights has been deprecated, so a Log Analytics workspace is now added to the deployment [#320](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/pull/320)
4. Cromwell updated to version 73
5. Fixes an issue where the "outputs" container is continually created resulting in 409 codes in the Azure Storage logs
6. Added VmOsProvider and VmOsName to the Deployer parameters to enable setting the values during deployment [#272](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/pull/272)


## Update instructions

You can update any previous CoA deployment to 3.0.0:
1. Follow instructions to [run the deployment executable](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure#run-the-deployment-executable), and for arguments, specify `--Update true --SubscriptionId abc123 --ResourceGroupName mycoa --VmPassword password` with the correct values for your existing CoA deployment. If you don't remember the password for the `vmadmin` user, you can reset it via the Azure Portal or Azure CLI.  Example:<br/>
 
`.\deploy-cromwell-on-azure.exe --Update true --SubscriptionId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --ResourceGroupName mycoa --VmPassword password`
