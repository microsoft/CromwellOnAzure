# Welcome to Cromwell on Azure
![Logo](/docs/screenshots/logo.png)

[Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a workflow management system for scientific workflows, orchestrating the computing tasks needed for genomics analysis. Originally developed by the [Broad Institute](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell), Cromwell is also used in the GATK Best Practices genome analysis pipeline. Cromwell supports running scripts at various scales, including your local machine, a local computing cluster, and on the cloud. <br />

Cromwell on Azure configures all Azure resources needed to run workflows with Cromwell on the Microsoft Azure cloud, and uses the [GA4GH TES](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/backends/TES/) backend for orchestrating the tasks that create a workflow. The installation sets up an Azure Kubernetes cluster to run the Cromwell, TES, and Trigger Service containers, and uses the Azure Batch PaaS service to execute each task in a workflow on its own VM, enabling scale-out to thousands of machines.  Cromwell workflows can be written using the [WDL](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl) scripting language. To see examples of WDL scripts - see this ['Learn WDL'](https://github.com/openwdl/learn-wdl) repository on GitHub.<br />
